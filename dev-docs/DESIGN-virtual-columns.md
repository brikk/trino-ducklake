# DESIGN: Virtual Columns (`$path`, `$row_id`, `$snapshot_id`, `$file_row_number`)

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED — all four columns ship on the read path (parquet, duckdb, inlined).
**Scope:** trino-ducklake connector. Read path only.
**Companion to:** [TODO-READ-MODE.md § Virtual Columns](TODO-READ-MODE.md#virtual-columns).

> **Implementation notes (as built).**
> - Handles use the sentinel-`columnId` pattern on `DucklakeColumnHandle`
>   (not a separate type) — § 3.4. The `VirtualKind` enum is the source of
>   truth; `virtualKind()` / `isVirtual()` are the helpers.
> - Virtuals appear in BOTH `getColumnHandles` and `getTableMetadata`
>   (`hidden=true`) — the hidden flag, not absence, excludes them from
>   `SELECT *` / `DESCRIBE` (corrected from the original sketch — § 4.1).
> - Constant virtuals (`$path`, `$snapshot_id`) are injected by an outer
>   `VirtualColumnInjectingPageSource` (RLE blocks). Row-varying virtuals
>   (`$file_row_number`, `$row_id`) are injected IN-pipeline before delete
>   filtering by `PositionalVirtualInjectingPageSource` (a generalization of
>   the old single-column row-id injector), so they reflect true file
>   positions — § 4.2.
> - `$snapshot_id` source is a new `beginSnapshot` field on `DucklakeSplit`
>   (parquet/duckdb). When a positional virtual is requested, predicate
>   pushdown is disabled (like the active-deletes case) so cumulative-offset
>   positions stay aligned with the file.
>
> **Inlined `$snapshot_id` is per-row.** Inlined rows are versioned catalog
> rows that each carry their own `begin_snapshot`, so `$snapshot_id` on inlined
> data is genuinely per-row (not a single split value). `createInlinedPageSource`
> reads it via `DucklakeCatalog.readInlinedBeginSnapshots` (ordered by `row_id`,
> aligned with `readInlinedData`) and weaves it into the in-memory record set
> alongside the NULL file-bound virtuals — no outer wrapper on the inlined path.
>
> **Note:** `$row_id` shares the name with the MERGE row-id channel (distinct
> handles, ids -104 vs -100) — § 3.6; covered by the full merge/delete suite.

## 1. Goal

Expose DuckLake's row-lineage metadata as hidden columns Trino users can
reference by name in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and similar clauses — without
polluting `SELECT *` or `DESCRIBE`. Matches the pattern Trino's Iceberg
and Delta connectors use (`$path`, `$pos`, `$file_modified_time`).

DuckDB exposes the same information through unprefixed names
(`rowid`, `snapshot_id`, `filename`, `file_row_number`, `file_index`).
We expose the high-value subset under `$`-prefixed names; aliases
deferred.

## 2. v1 scope — four columns

| Column | Type | Source | Per-split or per-row? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `$path` | `VARCHAR` | `DucklakeDataFile.path()` via `DucklakePathResolver` | constant per split |
| `$snapshot_id` | `BIGINT` | `DucklakeDataFile.beginSnapshot()` | constant per split |
| `$file_row_number` | `BIGINT` | Parquet's positional metadata column | per row, 0-based |
| `$row_id` | `BIGINT` | embedded Parquet row ID first; otherwise present `rowIdStart + $file_row_number` | logical identity, preserved across rewrites |

**Also shipped:** `$file_size_bytes` (`BIGINT`, the data file's size from
`DucklakeSplit.fileSizeBytes`, constant per split, NULL on inlined data).

**Intentionally NOT exposed** (evaluated, declined — see § 8):
`$file_index` and `$filename`.

## 3. Key design decisions

### 3.1 Naming: `$`-prefix, not DuckDB-style unprefixed

Match Trino's lakehouse convention. Avoids collisions with user columns
named `filename`/`rowid` and signals "this is a connector synthetic
column" to BI tools that already special-case `$`-prefixed columns from
Iceberg/Delta. We can add a DuckDB-name alias mode later if anyone
actually asks for it; reversing the default would be the painful
direction.

### 3.2 `$row_id` is a scalar `BIGINT`, not Iceberg-style ROW

**CI-02 correction, 2026-09-11:** logical row identity comes from reserved
Parquet field ID `2147483540` when present, even if the catalog also supplies
a start. Otherwise it is `rowIdStart + physical_file_position`. Catalog
`0.10.0` preserves valid NULL starts on rewritten files; absence is never zero.
If neither identity source exists, requesting `$row_id` fails explicitly.
An ordinary data/physical-position read does not require logical identity.

The queryable value remains a scalar `BIGINT`. Physical mutation identity is
separate, just as in upstream DuckLake's delete/update operators — see § 3.6.

### 3.3 SPI mechanism: hidden columns

```java
ColumnMetadata.builder()
    .setName("$path")
    .setType(VARCHAR)
    .setHidden(true)
    .build();
```

Trino's hidden-column contract: not in `SELECT *`, not in `DESCRIBE`,
queryable by explicit name. Iceberg's `$path` is the template.

### 3.4 Handle representation: reserved sentinel `columnId` on `DucklakeColumnHandle`

**Decision (overrides the original sketch's separate-handle proposal).**
Virtual columns reuse the existing `DucklakeColumnHandle` record,
distinguished by a reserved **negative `columnId`** — the same pattern the
MERGE `$row_id` handle already uses (`ROW_ID_COLUMN_ID = -100`). Real
catalog columns always have non-negative ids, so the negative range is
collision-free. A `VirtualKind` enum is the single source of truth for each
virtual's reserved id, name, type, and value-source; a factory builds the
handle from the kind.

```kotlin
enum class VirtualKind(val columnId: Long, val columnName: String, val columnType: Type) {
    PATH(-101, "\$path", VARCHAR),
    SNAPSHOT_ID(-102, "\$snapshot_id", BIGINT),
    FILE_ROW_NUMBER(-103, "\$file_row_number", BIGINT),
    ROW_ID(-104, "\$row_id", BIGINT),  // queryable; distinct id from the MERGE channel's -100
}
```

**Why this over a separate `DucklakeVirtualColumnHandle` type:**

- Smaller blast radius — no `@JsonTypeInfo`/`@JsonSubTypes` polymorphism on
  `DucklakeColumnHandle`, which is Jackson-serialized throughout the split path.
- Matches the `$row_id` sentinel convention already in the code.

**Accepted downside + required mitigation.** Virtual-ness is a magic-number
convention, not a distinct type, so it is **not compiler-enforced**: a
consumer that treats a handle as a real catalog column (catalog lookup,
Parquet field id) will silently mishandle a virtual one if it forgets to
check, and the write-path rejection (§ 4.4) fails *open* rather than at
compile time. Mitigation is mandatory, not optional — centralize everything
behind the enum plus helpers on `DucklakeColumnHandle`:

- `fun virtualKind(): VirtualKind?` — non-null only for virtual handles
- `fun isVirtual(): Boolean`

and route the single write-path guard through `isVirtual()`. Keep the magic
numbers only inside `VirtualKind`. **Escape hatch:** if this convention
causes real bugs later, promote virtuals to a separate
`DucklakeVirtualColumnHandle` type (the original proposal) — a localized
refactor we can take then rather than pay for now.

The queryable `$row_id` (id `-104`, via `getColumnHandles`) and the MERGE
channel's `$row_id` (id `-100`, via `getMergeRowIdColumnHandle`) share only the
name. The queryable value is logical `BIGINT`; the mutation value is
`ROW(data_file_id BIGINT, position BIGINT)`. Distinct ids and types preserve
the distinction across planner and worker serialization.

### 3.5 Inlined-data behavior: NULL for file-bound virtuals

Inlined rows have no parquet file. Options considered:

| Option | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Reject queries that reference virtuals on inlined splits | Too surprising — users can't know in advance which path serves a row |
| Synthesize sentinel values | Lies |
| **Return NULL for file-bound virtuals** | **Pick.** SQL has NULL precisely for "value not applicable here" |

So on inlined splits: `$path` = NULL, `$file_row_number` = NULL,
`$row_id` = NULL; `$snapshot_id` = the inlined data's begin_snapshot
(still meaningful).

### 3.6 Don't conflate with MERGE row identity

**CI-02, user-approved implementation:** the internal MERGE channel carries
`DucklakeMergeRowId.TYPE`, a file-ID/physical-position locator. `DucklakeSplit`
supplies the catalog data-file ID. Routing uses that ID to keep a file's
mutations on one writer; the sink validates file bounds and writes standard
physical-position deletes. It does not infer ownership from logical ID ranges.

For UPDATE reinserts, the sink resolves the logical ID separately from the
source file's embedded lineage or present start. NULL starts, ID gaps, and
overlapping catalog starts therefore do not compromise physical routing.
This follows upstream `DuckLakeDelete` and `DuckLakeUpdate` at `c23aca43`.

## 4. Plumbing sketch

### 4.1 Surface (`DucklakeMetadata`)

- `getColumnHandles(session, tableHandle)` — append the virtual handles
  (built via `VirtualKind.columnHandle()`) to the column-handle map
- `getColumnMetadata(session, tableHandle, columnHandle)` — call
  `setHidden(handle.isVirtual())` so virtuals are marked hidden
- `getTableMetadata` — **must include** the virtuals, each with
  `setHidden(true)`. CORRECTION to the original sketch: Trino resolves a
  column reference against the table schema derived from `getTableMetadata`
  (via the default `getTableSchema`), so a hidden column that is *absent*
  here is "cannot be resolved". The `hidden` flag — not absence — is what
  keeps a column out of `SELECT *` / `DESCRIBE` / `information_schema`.
  Keep this list in lockstep with `getColumnHandles`.

### 4.2 Scan (`DucklakePageSourceProvider`)

- Inspect the requested column list. Partition into
  `(parquetSourceColumns, virtualColumns)`
- Build the inner parquet page source with only `parquetSourceColumns`
- Current file-position injection counts rows from zero over a whole-file
  split, before deletion filtering; predicate/row-group pruning is disabled
  when positions are required. A future sub-file split/pruning implementation
  must supply authoritative physical positions instead.
- The positional injector and outer constant wrapper produce:
  - For `$path`, `$snapshot_id` → `RunLengthEncodedBlock(constant, positionCount)`
  - For `$file_row_number` → physical position
  - For `$row_id` → embedded lineage first, then a present start plus position
  - For the MERGE channel → `ROW(split.dataFileId, physical_position)`

### 4.3 Inlined path

`DucklakeInlinedSplitPageSource` (or wherever inlined rows are served)
emits NULL blocks for `$path` / `$file_row_number` / `$row_id` and the
snapshot constant for `$snapshot_id`. Keep this in one place — don't
sprinkle the NULL logic across pages.

### 4.4 Write path

`DucklakeMetadata.beginInsert` / `beginCreateTable` / `applyMerge`
must reject virtual column handles in the input list with a clear
`NOT_SUPPORTED` ("virtual columns cannot be written"). Add the check
at the entry points, not deep in the page sink.

## 5. Test plan

**Unit:**

- `getColumnHandles` returns the 4 virtuals as hidden, plus all user
  columns as visible
- `DucklakeVirtualColumnHandle` round-trips through Jackson (Trino
  serializes handles for split distribution)
- Write-path entry points reject virtual handles with `NOT_SUPPORTED`

**Cross-engine:**

- Insert a known set of rows; assert `$path` is the resolved file path
  and ends with `.parquet`
- Assert `$file_row_number` runs `0..N-1` per file
- For fresh insert files without lineage, assert `$row_id` matches a present
  `rowIdStart + file_row_number` per split. For rewritten files, assert ID gaps
  survive and embedded lineage wins over both NULL and present catalog starts.
- Assert `$snapshot_id` equals the snapshot that ran the INSERT
- DELETE half the rows → query `$row_id`; assert the remaining set is
  the original minus the deleted ones (no stale rows leak through)
- Inlined-data table → query `$path`/`$row_id`/`$file_row_number`,
  assert NULL; query `$snapshot_id`, assert non-null
- Confirm `SELECT *` from the table does NOT include virtuals
- Confirm `DESCRIBE` does NOT include virtuals
- Confirm `SELECT $path, COUNT(*) FROM t GROUP BY $path` works (i.e.
  the virtuals plug into the rest of the planner cleanly)

## 6. Estimate

~2 focused days.

- **Day 1**: Surface hidden columns; implement `$path` + `$snapshot_id`
  (constant-per-split) end-to-end with tests.
- **Day 2**: `$file_row_number` + `$row_id` (row-varying, needs the
  Parquet positional-metadata hookup); inlined-data NULL behavior;
  README + IMPACT-doc updates.

## 7. Risks / unknowns

The only non-trivial piece is wiring `$file_row_number` from Trino's
Parquet reader. Iceberg does this and its pattern is the reference.
If that pattern doesn't map cleanly onto `DucklakePageSourceProvider`'s
structure, the degraded fallback is: count positions in the
injecting page source (one add per page). Slower for huge files but
correct, and the failure is local to one component.

## 8. Out of scope (evaluated, declined)

- **`$file_index`** — DuckDB's `file_index` is the 0-based ordinal of a file
  within the *current scan's* file list (`WHERE file_index=1` selects the 2nd
  file read; see DuckDB's `parquet_virtual_columns.test`). That is a scan-local,
  order-dependent value with no stable meaning in Trino's distributed, one-file-
  per-split model — a split has no deterministic index among all splits. The
  catalog's `file_order` is stable but is *different* semantics, so exposing it
  under this name would mislead. Declined rather than ship a divergent column.
- **`$filename`** — DuckDB's `filename` returns the full file path, which is
  exactly our `$path`. Adding it would be a pure alias with no new information.
  Declined; use `$path`.
- DuckDB-name aliases (`rowid`, `filename`, etc.) — see § 3.1
- Using `$row_id` as the merge row-id source — see § 3.6
- Virtual columns on metadata tables (`$files`, `$snapshots`) — they
  already expose lineage via their own column set

**Done (was a follow-up):** Predicate pushdown on `$path` — `WHERE "$path" = …`
/ IN-list prunes data files in `DucklakeSplitManager.pruneByPath` before the
scan (evaluates each file's resolved path against the `$path` domain from the
table handle's `unenforcedPredicate`). Purely an optimization; the engine
re-applies the predicate above the scan, so results are correct regardless.
Inlined splits aren't pruned (small/few) — left to the engine's filter.
