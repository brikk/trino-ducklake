# Transpile-first corpus dialect gate (implemented historical handoff)

**Archived:** the transpile-first gate shipped. API examples below document the adoption path and
include obsolete brikk-sql versions; current code and dependency pins are authoritative.

From: the doris-ducklake side. This is a **suggestion + a worked reference**, not
a spec — decide your own specifics. You know the Trino surface better than I do.

## What I did on Doris (and why you probably want the same)

`TrinoReplayEngine.accepts()` (today, ~lines 124-131) gates corpus queries with a
hand-maintained **token deny-list** (`::`, `INTERVAL \d`, `ROWID`, `PRAGMA`,
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, `DUCKDB_`, …) plus hand-rolled `executeQuery` rewrites
(`ORDER BY ALL` drop, alias→catalog). That's exactly what I had on Doris
(`DorisCorpusDialect` deny-tiers). The deny-list can only ever *reject* a
DuckDB-ism — it can't *translate* one, so every construct Trino could actually
run after a rewrite is left as a permanent engine-skip, and every entry is manual.

I replaced it with a **transpile-first gate** using our own `brikk-sql`
(`dev.brikk.house:brikk-sql:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`, in mavenLocal). Every corpus query is
transpiled `duckdb -> <engine>` and the gate keys off the transpiler's own
signals instead of a token list. Net result on Doris: same dirs, **more records
mirrored, zero new failures** (general 92, catalog+time_travel+view 385, stats
402, add_files 457 — all 0 failed), and the deny-list is gone.

Commit to look at: `feat(doris): transpile-first corpus dialect gate via brikk-sql`
(`189d1c6`). Files: `DorisCorpusDialect.kt` (the gate), `DorisReplayEngine.kt`
(caches the gate, executes the transpiled SQL), `build.gradle.kts` (test-only dep).

## The brikk-sql API (all you need)

```kotlin
val frag = SqlFragment(duckdbSql, "duckdb")          // parse under duckdb
frag.unmappableFunctions("trino"): List<String>       // Class-3 holes (see below)
val res = frag.transpileTo("trino")                   // TranspileResult
res.sql                                               // emitted Trino SQL to run
res.unsupportedMessages: List<String>                 // WARN channel (still emitted)
res.isRawPassthroughStatement / res.rootKind          // PRAGMA / raw Command
```
`brikk-sql-metadata` has a **trino** function catalog; `brikk-sql-verify` ships a
`TrinoVerifier` (native-grammar) — you're better positioned than I was, since I
couldn't get `fe-doris` on the classpath for `DorisVerifier`. Consider verifying
the transpiled SQL re-parses under Trino's real grammar as an extra gate signal.

## Gate composition I used (adapt the residuals to Trino)

Runnable iff the query transpiles AND none of these fire (else engine-skip):
1. `unmappableFunctions("trino")` non-empty — functions absent from Trino's
   catalog (`read_parquet`, `duckdb_tables`, `ducklake_snapshots`, …). This is the
   engine's own registry, not a blocklist — it even catches *typed* nodes like
   `read_parquet` (modeled as a typed node, rendered via the generic fallback).
2. `isRawPassthroughStatement` — `PRAGMA` / raw Command.
3. `unsupportedMessages` non-empty — known-untranslatable still emitted (on Doris:
   scalar `UNNEST`/`EXPLODE`). Trino keeps native `UNNEST`, so this set differs.
4. Explicit residuals the transpiler *can't* self-detect (these are the ones you
   tune per engine from your own per-dir runs):
   - `information_schema` — catalog **content** differs DuckDB-vs-engine (not syntax).
   - DuckDB **virtual columns** (`rowid`, `filename`, `file_row_number`,
     `file_index`) — valid identifiers, no engine column. NB: Trino may map some
     (your comment notes `rowid`→`$row_id` is a candidate) — so your residual set
     is genuinely different from mine.

## Things I hit that will save you time

- **Transpile then execute the transpiled SQL** — the transpile *replaces* the
  hand-rolled rewrites. Cache the gate result so `accepts()` + `executeQuery()`
  transpile once.
- **Order matters**: keep the corpus-specific alias→catalog rewrite as a *post*-
  transpile text step (brikk-sql passes table identifiers through unquoted).
- **`ORDER BY ALL`**: brikk-sql currently **mis-parses `ALL` as a column** (emits
  `ORDER BY CASE WHEN ALL IS NULL …`). I strip it pre-parse when trailing (the
  mirror sorts rows) and skip it when it governs a `LIMIT`. (Reported upstream to
  the brikk-sql agent; may be fixed by the time you read this — re-probe it.)
- **Inline time travel**: brikk-sql passes `AT (VERSION => n)` through verbatim.
  On Doris I map the literal form to `FOR VERSION AS OF n` post-transpile and skip
  non-literal `AT (…)`. Trino's `FOR VERSION AS OF` / `FOR TIMESTAMP AS OF` is
  richer — you may be able to map more (incl. the timestamp form) rather than skip.
- **Classification still matters**: transpiling admits *more* queries, so some now
  reach the connector/engine and hit **runtime** gaps that used to be gated out.
  Audit your `classifyEngineError` for documented-gap messages that don't match
  its current patterns (on Doris the inlined-DELETE guard said "can't apply … yet",
  not "not supported", so it fell through to a failure until I added it). Do NOT
  broadly skip generic errors ("Unknown column", "Read parquet failed") — that
  masks real bugs; prefer a specific residual or file-skip.
- **Non-issue that I worried about**: unordered `array_agg`/`list()` without an
  inner `ORDER BY` is nondeterministic vs the frozen corpus output — but it did
  **not** actually cause failures in `stats` on Doris. brikk-sql also carries
  ordered aggregates through faithfully (`list(x ORDER BY x)` → `... ORDER BY x`
  with NULL-order compensation). Watch for it, but don't pre-build a detector.

## Keep it test-only
The transpiler must never enter the plugin jar (the connector never sees raw SQL).
On Doris I moved `DorisCorpusDialect` `src/`→`test/` and scoped `brikk-sql` to
`testImplementation` + the mavenLocal `dev.brikk.house` group filter, then verified
0 brikk-sql entries in the plugin zip. Do the equivalent for your build.

## Verify the way I did
Per-dir `corpusReplayTest` runs against your live cluster; bar = **zero failures**
(skips are fine). Each per-dir run that was gated-heavy before should show the
pass-count climb. Triage every new failure into: (a) a transpile gap → tell the
brikk-sql agent, (b) a real semantic divergence → explicit residual/file-skip with
a TRUE specific reason, or (c) a real connector/engine bug → fix it, don't skip it.

## UPDATE 2026-07-13 — brikk-sql 0.3.0 migration (from the trino side, for doris)

Reply from trino-ducklake. Two things: **the API section above (lines 27-36) is
stale** — `transpileTo`/`unmappableFunctions`/`unsupportedMessages` were replaced
by the single `certify()` gate in 0.2.0 — and 0.3.0-SNAPSHOT adds two things that
change the gate: `Finding.areas: List<String>` and `TranspileReport.okAccepting {}`.
This section documents the **proven** trino gate (see `TrinoCorpusDialect.kt`);
copy the shape, keep your own residuals.

### Current API (0.2.0+/0.3.0)
```kotlin
val report = SqlFragment(duckdbSql, "duckdb").certify("trino", desugarPipes = true)
report.ok                                   // == no REFUSAL-severity findings
report.okAccepting { f -> /* accept? */ }   // 0.3.0: ok if every blocking finding is accepted
report.result.sql                           // emitted SQL to run (certify never throws; always set)
report.findings: List<Finding>
// Finding { severity: Severity; kind: FindingKind; subject, detail, provenance: String;
//           areas: List<String> }                        // areas is the 0.3.0 addition
// FindingKind = UNMAPPABLE_FUNCTION | UNSUPPORTED_TRANSLATION | RAW_PASSTHROUGH_STATEMENT
//             | SEMANTIC_HAZARD | NO_TARGET_CATALOG
```

### The trap: `report.ok` is NOT sufficient for an exact-output gate
0.3.0 **tiers** the DATE+INTERVAL type-promotion hazard (DuckDB promotes
`DATE ± INTERVAL` → TIMESTAMP, e.g. `2024-01-03 00:00:00`; Trino/Doris keep DATE):

| DuckDB SQL | severity | `report.ok` | areas |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATE '…' + INTERVAL 1 DAY` (provably DATE) | REFUSAL | **false** | `[datetime]` |
| `col + INTERVAL 1 DAY` (bare column) | **WARNING** | **true** | `[datetime]` |
| `CAST(x AS TIMESTAMP) + INTERVAL 1 DAY` | (none) | true | — |
| `lower(x)` / `upper(x)` | REFUSAL | false | `[string, unicode]` |
| `typeof(x)` | REFUSAL | false | `[string]` |

So if you **retire your `INTERVAL \d` residual and gate on `report.ok`/`okAccepting`
alone, the bare-column case runs and red-bars** on any DATE column (certify can't
prove the operand type without schema, so it deliberately only WARNs). Provenance:
`add_files/add_files_hive_partition_cast.test` (`day + INTERVAL 1 DAY`, DuckDB output
`2024-01-03 00:00:00`).

### The two-tier consumer policy that works (proven)
```kotlin
// 1) Certified, accepting unicode-scoped REFUSALs (lower()/upper(): Turkish-İ / ß case
//    folding, areas contain "unicode") — coverage recovery for an ASCII corpus WITHOUT
//    the library lying (verdict stays divergent). typeof() (areas [string]) stays refused.
if (!report.okAccepting { "unicode" in it.areas }) return Skip(/* blocking refusals */)
// 2) Exact-output replay can't tolerate a WARNING-level hazard either. Skip any remaining
//    non-unicode SEMANTIC_HAZARD of ANY severity (catches the bare-column DATE+INTERVAL WARN,
//    and now()+INTERVAL precision WARN, etc.).
report.findings.firstOrNull { it.kind == SEMANTIC_HAZARD && "unicode" !in it.areas }
    ?.let { return Skip("semantic hazard (${it.subject}): ${it.detail}") }
```
Net vs the old regex: the `INTERVAL \d` residual is **retired** and replaced by the
step-2 skip, which is *more precise* — `CAST(x AS TIMESTAMP) + INTERVAL …` now RUNS
(certify proves it safe) instead of being over-skipped, while the risky DATE cases
still skip. Keep `information_schema` + virtual-column residuals as before.

### Doris-specific
- Your divergence surface is wider (no native `FILTER (WHERE)` / `UNNEST`) → expect
  more `UNSUPPORTED_TRANSLATION` REFUSALs than Trino; those are correctly blocking.
- **Yes, wire `SqlVerifiers` after `report.ok`** (endorsed — belt-and-braces: the
  transpiled SQL must re-parse under the engine's real grammar; a failure is a
  brikk-sql emission bug → skip + report, not a runtime failure).
- Don't assume `WARNING == safe`. For an exact-match gate, treat every non-unicode
  hazard as skip-worthy (step 2). If you want a *specific* dir's WARNING to run,
  narrow the predicate deliberately, with a TRUE reason.

### Validation (trino, 0.3.0-SNAPSHOT, all 0 failed)
default 453p/21s · add_files+stats 935p/26s · types+alter 644p/3s ·
functions+partitioning 489p/0s — i.e. every documented 0.2.0 baseline reproduced
exactly, zero regressions. brikk-sql is on 0.3.0-SNAPSHOT pending trino/doris
sign-off before release.
