/**
 * A resolved write-side sort key: the zero-based page CHANNEL index (its position in
 * [DucklakeWritableTableHandle.columns], which is exactly the block layout the page sink
 * receives) plus the [SortOrder] to apply.
 *
 * The channel — rather than the column name — is stored because that is precisely what
 * [io.trino.spi.PageSorter.sort] consumes, and it stays valid even when the sink appends a
 * trailing synthetic channel (the row-lineage rowid), since sort channels only ever index
 * the leading catalog columns. [DucklakeSortPropertyMapper.resolveHonoredPrefix] resolves
 * which keys are honored, in what order; it does not imply scan ordering across files.
