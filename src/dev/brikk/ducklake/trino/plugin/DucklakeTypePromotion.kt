/**
 * Widening-only type-promotion rules for `ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN … SET DATA TYPE`, expressed in
 * Trino types. DuckLake permits only *widening* promotions so that data files written under the old
 * physical type still read correctly (by a lossless-or-widening cast) under the new type; a
 * narrowing change would corrupt existing rows. We mirror that contract on the Trino write side and
 * reject anything else at DDL time (a `NOT_SUPPORTED` in [DucklakeMetadata.setColumnType]).
 *
 * The rules are the Trino projection of DuckLake's promotion set (see
 * `ducklake/test/sql/alter/promote_type_all.test`): the signed-integer widening chain, integer → floating,
 * `REAL → DOUBLE`, and `TIMESTAMP → TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`. Unsigned/HUGEINT rungs of DuckDB's
 * chain have no distinct Trino type (they surface as the next-larger signed / decimal), so they are
 * not separately enumerated. When in doubt we are conservative — declining a promotion is safe
 * (the user can rewrite the data); allowing a narrowing is not.
