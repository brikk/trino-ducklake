/**
 * Pins [DeleteRowFilterTransform]'s two-vocabulary contract:
 * global row ids and file-local offsets are matched ONLY under their own interpretation.
 *
 * Two regressions are guarded:
 *
 *  1. **Vocabulary aliasing** — global ids numerically overlap local offsets whenever a
 *     file's `rowIdStart < recordCount`. The previous single-set design checked every value
 *     under both interpretations and phantom-deleted rows (first observed as the
 *     nondeterministic spread-delete failure in [AbstractDucklakeRowLevelFormatTest]).
 *  2. **Duplicate overlap** (upstream
 *     [duckdb/ducklake#1084](https://github.com/duckdb/ducklake/issues/1084)) — their C++
 *     reader merges delete positions into a sorted vector *without dedup* and the filter
 *     wedges on the duplicate, leaking every later tombstone. Our per-vocabulary [Set]s
 *     dedup intrinsically and the same logical row encoded in both vocabularies must drop
 *     exactly once.
