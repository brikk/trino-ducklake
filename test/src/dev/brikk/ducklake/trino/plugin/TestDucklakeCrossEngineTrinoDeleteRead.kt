/**
 * The reverse direction of [TestDucklakeCrossEnginePuffinDeleteRoundTrip]: TRINO performs the
 * row-level DELETE/UPDATE and DUCKDB reads the surviving rows. This is the verification spike
 * for a suspected interop hole — Trino's merge sink writes positional delete files as a single
 * `row_id` column holding GLOBAL row ids, while the DuckLake spec (and DuckDB's reader) expects
 * `(file_path, pos)` with FILE-LOCAL positions. Whatever this proves becomes the contract.
 *
 * SAME_THREAD: writes to the shared catalog; concurrent commits would race the snapshot retry.
