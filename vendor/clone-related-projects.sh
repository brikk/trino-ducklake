#
# Bootstraps (or refreshes) the vendored upstream repos this project tracks
# for research and audit. None of these repos are built or shipped — they
# are read-only working copies used by the upstream-tracking workflow
# described in `dev-docs/RESEARCH-upstreams.md`.
#
# Usage:
#   ./vendor/clone-related-projects.sh         # clone any missing, fetch the rest
#   ./vendor/clone-related-projects.sh --pull  # additionally fast-forward each repo
#
# Idempotent: missing repos are cloned; existing repos get `git fetch
# --all --prune` (and optionally `git pull --ff-only` on the current
# branch when --pull is passed).
#
# This script never modifies working-tree state of an existing repo
# beyond fetching, unless --pull is explicitly passed. The
# research procedure relies on local HEAD staying at the previous
# baseline until the user advances it explicitly.
